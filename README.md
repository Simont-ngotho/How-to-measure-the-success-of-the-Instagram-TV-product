Project - Option 1: Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?


**PROJECT**

As a Data Scientist at Instagram, it is paramount for me to measure the success of Intagram TV Product to help the management make data driven decisions on viability or the value preposition against the investment of the same. To help me in my assignment, I will need to use different metrics as listed below. 

**1.	User Interactions**
In order to get insights of user interactions within Instagram, it important to evaluate below key features.

**a.	Views:** This is tracking the number of times a post has been viewed over a period of time. The trends in viewership will be crucial in communicating growth or otherwise.  

**b.	Followers:** Tracking the number of follows over a given period of time will help in monitoring growth or decline

**c.	Subscribers:** The number of subscription helps in determining the relevance of the TV and likeability. It is a good way measuring the success of the TV as it is an indication of loyalty. 

**3.	User behaviours**

**a.	User retention:** This is tracking the number of times the same users return to the content. 

**b.	Drop-offs:** Tracking the number of drop-offs on every post will help show how interested users are with the product. High drop-offs shows lack of interest and vice versa. 

**4.	Content uploaded**
Increasing number of content created by users is good way of measuring the effectiveness of a product. A reduction in content should form basis of re-inventing the wheel to improve efficiency. 

**5.	Feedback from users**
Likes, Shares and Comments is a good metrics of measuring the effectiveness of the product. The more they are, the more it is likely that the users are liking the product(s). 

**6.	Time** 

**a.	Watching time:** Monitoring the length of time that viewers, content creators spend on Instagram will help tell the effectiveness of the product.

**b.	Clips/Video/content length:** An analysis of the time spent by users on posts against their length is a good way of gauging the effectiveness. 

**7.	Cost Analysis**
This is a measure of the investment of the Instagram TV from cost of production, cost of resources needed, and human resource capital against the value realized.

**8.	Ratings and Surveys**
Use of surveys and ratings is a good way of determining how the users liked the content. The higher the rating the higher the effectiveness. 

**9.	Competitor Analysis** 
It is paramount to analyse the competitors’ data which will be used in tandem with other metrics. A decline in users/subscribers may mean preference to the alternatives by the users. 

**10.	User friendliness**
The time spent by users to navigate to a particular icon/item in the platform can be used to measure the user friendliness. The comments/complaints can be used to tell how users find it easy to use Instagram. 

**11.	Ethics and Principles**
How ethical the content is, affects the user interactions. While the younger generation may find it relaxing to share any content, the older generation might shun from using Instagram which directly affects the subscription. By use of geographical data, it is possible to measure the ethics of contents from the comments and demographics of user. E.g. Asia and Africa might be sensitive to content while parts of Europe and America might show different data.
